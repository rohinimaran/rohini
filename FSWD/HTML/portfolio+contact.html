    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I design the user interfaceâ€”the part of the website you directly interact with. Think of it as the dining area
        of a restaurant. It includes layouts, buttons, forms, and everything visible on the site.Similar to the kitchen
        in a restaurant, the backend handles behind-the-scenes work. It includes servers, applications, and databases.
        When you submit a form on a website, the backend processes the data and provides the requested information or
        service.</p>
